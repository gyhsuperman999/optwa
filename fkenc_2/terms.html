        <p>Welcome to <strong>Pretty Converter Toolkit</strong> (the “Service”). These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) are a legal agreement between you and the operator of the Service (“we”, “us”, or “our”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided by <strong>[Your Company Name]</strong> (“Company”). For contact details, see the <a href="about.html">About</a> page or the “Contact Us” section in our Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You must use the Service in compliance with applicable laws and these Terms.</li>
          <li>You may not attempt to interfere with, disrupt, or circumvent the security or access controls of the Service.</li>
          <li>You may not use the Service for unlawful purposes, to infringe intellectual property, or to engage in high‑volume scraping, mirroring, or automated bulk extraction without our permission.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>Except where otherwise stated, the Service, its content, and branding are owned by the Company or its licensors and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws. These Terms do not transfer any ownership rights to you.</p>

        <h2>4. Third‑Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Service may reference or integrate third‑party services or content. We are not responsible for third‑party sites or services and make no representations regarding them. Your use of third‑party services is at your own risk and may be governed by separate terms.</p>

        <h2>5. No Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided on an <strong>“AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”</strong> basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non‑infringement, and availability. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error‑free.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall we be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, goodwill, or business interruption, arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability shall not exceed the greater of (i) the amount you paid to use the Service in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or (ii) USD $100.</p>

        <h2>7. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from or relating to your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to the Service</h2>
        <p>We may modify or discontinue the Service (in whole or in part) at any time, with or without notice. We may also update these Terms. If we make material changes, we will post the updated Terms with a new “Last updated” date. Your continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time if we believe you have violated these Terms or applicable law. Upon termination, provisions that by their nature should survive will remain in effect (including Sections 3–7 and 10–12).</p>

        <h2>10. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>England and Wales</strong>, without regard to conflict‑of‑laws principles. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in London, United Kingdom. If you prefer a different jurisdiction, replace this clause with the governing law and venue applicable to your company.</p>
