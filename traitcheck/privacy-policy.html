    <section id="data-we-process">
      <h2>3) Information We Process</h2>

        <li><strong>Cookies & similar technologies.</strong> We use cookies and local storage to keep site preferences and to enable analytics and advertising. See <a href="#cookies">Cookies</a> below.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="legal-bases">
      <h2>4) Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK)</h2>

    <section id="analytics">
      <h2>6) Analytics (Google Analytics)</h2>
      <p>We use Google Analytics to understand how our site is used. Google Analytics collects information such as page views, browser type, and interactions. IP addresses in GA4 are anonymized by Google. You can opt out by installing the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics Opt‑out Add‑on</a> or by using your browser’s tracking protection settings.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="cookies">
      <h2>7) Cookies & Similar Technologies</h2>
      <p>Cookies are small files saved on your device. We use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong> – required for core functionality and security.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance/analytics cookies</strong> – to measure use and improve the Service (e.g., <code>_ga</code>, <code>_ga_*</code>).</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising cookies</strong> – set by Google and partners to deliver, limit, and measure ads.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can control cookies in your browser settings (block, delete, or limit) and via the choice tools listed above. Blocking cookies may affect some features.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="retention">
      <h2>8) Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We keep data only as long as necessary for the purposes listed in this Policy, to meet legal obligations, or to resolve disputes. Google Analytics retention is managed within our GA settings. Advertising cookies follow the lifetimes defined by Google and its partners.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sharing">
      <h2>9) How We Share Information</h2>
      <p>We do not sell personal information. We share data with service providers (e.g., Google) to operate analytics and advertising, subject to their terms and applicable law. We may also share information to comply with legal requests or to protect our rights, users, and the public.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="transfers">
      <h2>10) International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) offered by our providers.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="your-rights">
      <h2>11) Your Privacy Rights</h2>
      <p><strong>EEA/UK users</strong> have the right to request access, correction, deletion, restriction, portability, and to object to processing, as well as to withdraw consent at any time (without affecting the lawfulness of prior processing).</p>
      <p><strong>California residents (CCPA/CPRA)</strong> have the right to know, correct, delete, and to opt out of “sale” or “sharing” of personal information for cross‑context behavioral advertising. We do not sell personal information. To exercise rights or to opt out of “sharing,” contact us as described below.</p>
      <p>We may need to verify your identity and will respond within the timelines required by law.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="children">
      <h2>12) Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our Service is not directed to children under 13 (or the age of digital consent in your region). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="security">
      <h2>13) Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="dnt">
      <h2>14) Do Not Track</h2>
      <p>Some browsers send a “Do Not Track” (DNT) signal. Because there is no common industry standard, our Service does not respond to DNT signals. You can still use the controls and opt‑out options described above.</p>
