                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>ENTJ: Extroversion, Intuition, Thinking, Judging. ENTJs are great leaders and decision makers. They are brilliant thinkers and long-term planners. Being very practical and logical, they excel at tasks requiring reasoning and intelligence. ENTJs value truth and will only be convinced through logical reasoning. ENTJs are very systematic in planning and researching new things. They are natural, honest and enthusiastic leaders who are good at organizing people. They live very disciplined lives and expect others to do the same. Therefore, they challenge and push others to work as hard as they do.</p>
                    <h3>Detailed Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>Friendly, strong-willed, and direct; honest and rational, with high standards for themselves and others; constantly strive to demonstrate their abilities; have a global perspective; capable and decisive, with a well-organized approach; and enjoy working with others.</p>
                    <p>For ENTJs, the most important thing in life is to showcase their strengths and achieve significant accomplishments. They are natural leaders and commanders. This is evident not only in their charm and leadership skills when they are world leaders but also in their leadership skills when they are religious leaders.</p>
                    <p>ENTJs often describe their projects and plans in a narrative style, which is useful for salespeople, comedians, and storytellers. Their natural ability to "block" others gives them an edge in convincing customers to accept their requests.</p>
                    <p>ENTJs are decisive. They know exactly what needs to be done and then assign the tasks accordingly. Other types of people rarely have the same ability to make quick decisions and defeat strong opponents when faced with challenges. When challenged, they become very argumentative; or they may give a cold stare, which seems to convey the message: ENTJ cannot be underestimated.</p>
                    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                    <p>ENTJs sometimes rush to make decisions. Taking a moment to slow down can give them a chance to gather all relevant data and consider the situation carefully. However, ENTJs are generally straightforward and impatient, insensitive, inflexible, and difficult to approach. They need to listen to the voices of those around them and appreciate their contributions. They often focus too much on reality and neglect feelings. When their feelings are ignored or not expressed, they are very sensitive. If someone questions their abilities, especially someone they respect, this feeling is particularly strong. They may lose their temper over small things and this outburst can hurt those close to them. If they take some time to reflect and understand their true feelings, they will be very happy and the effect will be good. Correctly releasing their emotions instead of exploding will help them better control themselves and achieve their desired and hard-fought positions.</p>

They like to apply their knowledge to the world around them and usually have careers that allow them to extend their educational responsibilities to other areas, such as politics or political consulting.</p>

These jobs require some innate abilities for ENTJs: the ability to understand and handle complex problems, a strong logical mind, the ability to grasp the big picture, and excellent organizational skills.</p>
                    <h3>Job Search</h3>
                    <p>Understanding your strengths and weaknesses can help you succeed in your job search. From starting to seek potential job opportunities that suit you, contacting and contacting your potential future bosses, organizing self-promotion materials (such as resumes), arranging and conducting interviews, negotiating salary, to finally getting this job - in every aspect of this process, people will honestly show their personality. Whether you can showcase your strengths and弥补不足往往关系到你求职的成功与否。</p>
                    <p>The differences between different personality types can sometimes be subtle, and sometimes very obvious. It's these subtle differences in our advice that often determine the success or failure of a job search. "Interaction" (specifically, getting information from others), can be a good example. Extroverts love "interaction" and we encourage them to do so boldly; however, introverts only like to "interact" with a small group of people they know, and they find it easier to interact with familiar people. Feeling types tend to interact with people within a certain range; however, intuition types interact with many people, although their chat partners may not seem "compatible" with them.</p>
                    <h3>Success Path</h3>
                    <p>Because ENTJ has a wide range of abilities, most of them find job hunting relatively easy and interesting. In fact, ENTJs are great job seekers, and many career counselors are ENTJs. It's no wonder that the typical jobs listed for job seekers are tailor-made for ENTJs.</p>
