                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Introverted I, Intuitive N, Feeling F, and Perceiving P. INFPs are most outstanding and efficient when serving others and working towards their ideals. However, if work lacks meaning, their work effectiveness and efficiency will be greatly reduced. Obviously, INFPs most enjoy doing things that align with their values. However, if they are willing to slightly shift their perspective and view less interesting tasks as work that serves others, they will dedicate themselves to that work. For example, learning computers might be interesting to others, but for INFPs, learning computers just for the sake of learning would be a waste of time. However, if it's learning computers to help others understand computers and overcome problems, it might become very attractive to INFPs.</p>
                    <h3>Personality Traits</h3>
                    <p>INFPs tend to be quiet and reserved. They expend energy in social situations. Compared to concrete matters, INFPs are more concerned with abstract things. They tend to focus on the big picture rather than details, focusing on future possibilities rather than immediate realities. INFPs usually prioritize personal preferences over objective standards. When making decisions, they usually emphasize human relations over logic. INFPs will reserve judgment or postpone important decisions, preferring to "keep options open" and better able to handle changes.</p>
                    <h3>Career Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>As an INFP, job satisfaction means doing work that:</p>
                    <p>1. Aligns with my personal values and beliefs while allowing me to express my imagination.</p>
                    <p>2. Gives me time to develop my ideas in depth while maintaining control over this thinking process and its products.</p>
                    <h3>Development Suggestions</h3>
                    <p>Need to learn to work realistically rather than just pursuing perfection; need to develop resilience, practicality, and self-awareness to say "no"; need to place more emphasis on facts and logic; need to develop and implement action plans. Set realistic expectations; value compromise; avoid viewing issues too subjectively.</p>
                    <h3>Comprehensive Description</h3>
                    <p>INFP is introverted, focused (I), and prefers to observe surroundings in an abstract, visionary, and imaginative way (N). Their decisions are based on personal values, subjective decisions (F), not to control others, but to maintain self-integrity. INFP's life is very casual and flexible (P). These characteristics make INFP seem a bit traditional, but they are enthusiastic and friendly. Usually, it's comfortable to be with INFP. There's only one situation that makes INFP behave unusually - once they feel their defended values are threatened, they become very rigid.</p>
                    <h3>Organizational Contributions</h3>

                    <h3>Potential Work Weaknesses</h3>
                    <p>May delay work tasks due to perfectionism; trying to please too many people simultaneously; stubbornly refusing to adjust views based on logic and facts; spending too much time reconsidering without taking action.</p>
                    <h3>Interesting Details</h3>

                    <h3>Love</h3>
                    <p>INFPs always appear before people with a calm and happy attitude. They treat people calmly and kindly, without too many demands. In fact, INFP's inner world is very complex. In interpersonal communication, this complexity makes them show more love and care than other personality types. INFPs don't show this care to everyone, and they tend to be conservative in expressing internal emotions. This deep love and care in their hearts only show up in front of a few people who are very close to them.</p>
