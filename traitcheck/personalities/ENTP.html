                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>For ENTP types, the most important thing is to be creative, envision a beautiful future, and always maintain a sense of challenge. "Smart" is the most appropriate word to describe this type of person. ENTPs speak and think quickly. They enjoy debating both for their own benefit and to show off their debating skills. During debates, they like to display quirky humor and play devil's advocate. Those who don't view debate as a form of display often feel confused and even hurt when arguing with them.</p>

                    <h3>Detailed Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>Because ENTPs are very articulate, they are clever and skillful in problem-solving. However, sometimes they strive to "surpass" themselves, often "using any means necessary" - as long as conditions allow, they ignore certain rules to take shortcuts, even if it means failing in ambitious deceptive activities. Whether at work or at home, they like to play with various physical or intellectual toys, the more complex the better. Although they quickly become bored with old things.</p>

                    <p>ENTPs are basically optimistic. When facing major setbacks, they view them only as challenges and determinedly solve them; however, when encountering small setbacks or troubles, they easily lose their temper. ENTPs cannot tolerate those who are stubborn and slow-witted, and they make no effort to hide this. Actually, as long as there's nothing troublesome in their lives, they are usually friendly and pleasant, sometimes even quite likable.</p>

                    <h3>Interpersonal Relationships</h3>
                    <p>In terms of interpersonal relationships, they can quickly become intimate with those they love. Some people express these feelings privately; while others display their intimacy with loved ones so publicly that it surprises coworkers who only see their work side. ENTPs are also good at making friends with people who are as smart and interesting as they are. Apart from these two aspects, other aspects of human nature seem to be forgotten by ENTPs, unless when they are listeners - giving people either good, bad, or mixed impressions.</p>

They constantly ask themselves questions like "How can we improve the quality of our relationship?" "Where is this relationship heading?" "Am I growing in this relationship?"

Eventually, in romantic relationships, ENTPs become like the boy who cried wolf.</p>

                    <p>Regarding sex, ENTPs are passionate and put great effort into continuously improving both parties' experience. They are fully invested and questioning. They like to be natural while following rules, and are open to new concepts and adventures. They view sex more as a physical expression of conveying love rather than a direct opportunity to express love.</p>

                    <p>Overall, ENTPs have a childlike enthusiasm and genuine interest in the health and direction of love. Therefore, they hope to create a healthy growing romantic relationship with their partner. ENTPs need to pay attention to their feelings. When faced with exciting external potential values, ENTPs cannot ignore their emotions.</p>

                    <p>While any two well-developed individuals can have a healthy relationship, the best matches for ENTPs are INFJ or INTJ. ENTPs' dominant function is extroverted intuition, which best matches with those whose dominant function is introverted intuition.
