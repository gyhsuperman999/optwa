                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>INTP (Introverted/Intuitive/Thinking/Perceiving) is a personality type developed from Jung's analytical psychology through MBTI, Keirsey Temperament Sorter, and social personality studies.</p>
                    <h3>Personality Traits</h3>
                    <p>INTPs are free creators and scholars with flying thoughts. They are easily distracted but possess endless creativity. Their preference for abstract concepts and deep understanding allows them to engage in any work that requires creativity and challenges.</p>
                    <p>They like to be impulsive and easily come up with ideas, which can be quite genius. Sometimes these ideas can also make INTPs lose their way because they constantly have new ideas emerging.</p>
                    <p>INTPs become frustrated with mechanical work that has too many details or set deadlines. When faced with deadlines, they will constantly ask for extensions.</p>
                    <p>Almost all INTPs have one or more areas of expertise where they can be described as gifted. Once they fortunately engage in an industry that suits their taste, they can reach heights that many people might not achieve in decades or even a lifetime, thanks to their superior intuition in their professional field. However, outside these areas where they shine brilliantly, due to long-term neglect, many problems that are not issues for ordinary people can stump them, such as daily life. Perhaps a sudden household chore can expose their clumsy side, instantly transforming them from genius to fool.</p>
                    <p>INTP's characteristics will make this type of person willing to pursue adventure, but this may conflict with their preference for solitary thinking. For INTPs, the outside world is exciting, but it can interfere with their introspective self-reflection.</p>
                    <p>INTPs may encounter gender issues, and the situation may vary. For female INTPs, they may often be in a dilemma: the traditional definition of women and their natural preferences are often at odds with each other. For example, INTP may be independent, anti-authoritarian, argumentative, and sometimes may have social barriers (this is related to their I strength), and they often ignore social conventions. When these are combined with their INT's wisdom and indifference, we can imagine the difficulties INTP women may face. And the fact that female INTPs are not good at expressing themselves makes this situation more complicated.</p>
                    <p>Generally, INTPs will conduct thorough preparations before committing to a project. This is because, first, they don't want to appear weak; second, these preparations - research, reading, planning - are things INTPs like to do; third, INTPs need a good starting point.</p>
                    <p>In an environment that doesn't appreciate or doubt, women's situation may be more difficult. People will admire a sharp, calm person, but if it's a woman, people will think she's a bit cold and indifferent to others' feelings, like an old scholar, lacking women's gentleness. For male INTPs, their situation is relatively easier because calmness is the requirement of society. Even so, they may encounter some problems. For example, their adaptable and changeable personality may conflict with the majority of TJ managers in most companies. INTP is often reminded to "get back to work, don't dream anymore" or "hope you can follow the rules."</p>
                    <p>Another issue is that INTP lacks social awareness and is not good at socializing. This is more pronounced in men, while women are relatively easier to adjust. INTP may not be enthusiastic about company gatherings or other social activities, which may make colleagues feel they are not sociable. They are not unwilling to participate, but if they think this gathering can be tolerated, they may even enjoy it. However, if the activity lasts too long or there's nothing meaningful in the conversation and communication, they may feel it's a waste of time. So, INTP may continue working and searching for "meaningful conversation" in their world, whether male or female, INTP may eventually feel guilty because they have not fulfilled their social responsibilities. However, if they must fulfill this responsibility, they may think "I'm in trouble again."</p>
                    <p>In work, INTP is the source of ideas, and they are most efficient when working alone. They often show creativity, energy, and fun in their work. They like new projects and brainstorming, and for INTP, life and work are a challenge of wisdom. Before doing anything, they need to think carefully and thoroughly. They like to express things clearly and precisely in writing, and cannot tolerate vague or contradictory theories: for example, both supporting and opposing.</p>
                    <p>Overall, working with INTPs is relatively easy. They like to find joy in work, think independently, and prefer to work autonomously. They see life as learning. Therefore, any activity that can develop their intelligence is valuable, from disassembling to drafting project proposals, are opportunities for learning and growth. This is the main driving force for INTPs.</p>
                    <p>For INTPs, the most important thing is their privacy not being invaded and solving complex problems in their unique way. INTPs are good at thinking and analyzing, sometimes they even forget the world around them and immerse themselves in deep thought.</p>
                    <p>A more accurate description of INTPs is that if someone's understanding is slightly off, they will try to correct it. This is also why INTPs have a natural advantage in areas such as linguistics and language.</p>
                    <p>In most cases, INTPs can adapt and understand, they don't like to show themselves in public eyes; unless their principles are violated, they will speak frankly and openly, then quickly return to the friendly atmosphere.</p>
                    <p>INTPs always have a sense of failure and worry about failing in the next thing. They are more persuasive in debates than convincing themselves. In this regard, INTJ is completely different from INTP. They are very confident in their abilities and are willing to do whatever they believe in.</p>
                    <p>The energy source of INTP is introverted and introspective (I). Their impression of the world is conceptual, abstract, and random, with endless possibilities (N), which is the basis of decision-making. Their decisions are objective and strictly consider causal relationships (T). This forms a flexible, carefree, adaptable lifestyle (P).</p>
                    <p>So complex systems, such as mathematics, language, and computers, are what INTPs like and are willing to try. Understanding, exploring, and manipulating systems are often unconscious behaviors for INTPs. They can completely forget themselves and express the wonderful logical systems, interconnected subsystems, and environments separately; for them, completing tasks is secondary.</p>
                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Independent and quiet; wide and creative thinking; curious and proactive; rational and adaptable; independent but not blindly following.</p>
                    <p>INTPs are rational problem solvers. They are very intelligent and organized, and they show outstanding creative talent. INTPs are calm, silent, and detached; but they are deeply focused on analyzing problems. They are meticulous and skeptical. They strive to find and use principles to understand many ideas. They like to discuss things in a logical and purposeful manner, and they may argue about trivial issues just for fun.</p>
                    <p>INTPs are usually wise and independent thinkers. They value intelligence and have a strong desire for personal abilities. They are also interested in challenging others. INTPs are most interested in understanding possibilities beyond what can be accurately known, accepted, and obvious. They are willing to develop models to improve the situation or solve problems. Their thinking is extremely complex and can better organize concepts and ideas than people. Sometimes their ideas are too complex to express and understand to others. INTPs are very independent and like to take risks and engage in imaginative activities. They are flexible and open-minded, more interested in finding creative and reasonable solutions than just seeing the ready-made solutions in front of them.</p>
                    <p>INTPs are almost emotionless and ignore criticism and praise. They are born to be observers. They don't have a strong desire to influence others or hurt others. INTP's attention to others' feelings is usually zero, and they just want to express their true opinions. They gain a sense of accomplishment through logical reasoning and self-growth.</p>
                    <h3>Cognitive Functions</h3>
                    <p>Seeking precision, such as finding the most appropriate word to express a concept. It notices the subtle differences between the essence of things and classifies them. Ti carefully examines every aspect of a problem to find the easiest and least risky way to solve it. It uses models to identify logical inconsistencies. Calm and clear, it pays attention to the forces that hold reality together. As an introverted thinking type, INTP's energy and time are mainly used to manage the principles in the logical world (the essence of things, the original rules of things) and summarize them into something understandable. Ti is more inclined to broad logical similarity.</p>
                    <p>Finding and explaining implicit meanings, using "if" questions to explore choices, allowing multiple possibilities to coexist. This imaginative game combines intuition and experiences from various sources into new ones, which can act as catalysts for action. It allows INTP to understand the layout of their surroundings. They use their intuition to turn experiential data into coherent images, from which general principles can be derived. INTP often spends a long time pondering a question until it finally comes up with an answer with a moment of insight.</p>
                    <p>Collecting data about the present and comparing it with past experiences, sometimes this process is triggered by memories, as if experiencing it again. To protect the familiar things, they look back at history to form expectations and goals for the future. This gives INTP the potential to observe and collect data based on experience, using material tools, noticing material relationships, and supporting their inner logic with a spacious sensory space.</p>
                    <p>Finding social connections and creating a harmonious communication environment with politeness, tact, and courtesy. Responding to others' explicit (or implied) needs, even creating conflicts between their inner self and desires to satisfy others. This makes INTP crave harmony in groups. When they feel most relaxed, or when they have a clear role in the group, INTPs can be charming and straightforward friends. However, when under pressure, INTPs may feel disconnected from those around them and unable to communicate with them using their extroverted emotions.</p>
                    <p>Later researchers (especially Linda V. Berne) added four additional functions to this descending order. These functions are called hidden functions because they are not naturally inclined to them but will emerge under pressure. For INTP, these hidden functions are (in order):</p>
                    <p>Organizing, arranging environments, and ideas to achieve goals. More inclined to logical reasoning and narrow logic, seeking logical explanations for events and conclusions, and trying to find logical errors and gaps in sequences.</p>
                    <p>Combining contradictory things into previously unimaginable results, while also attracted to symbolic things. These results are often achieved with the need for action, and their solutions may include complex systems or general truths.</p>
                    <p>Focusing on the present, material world and experiencing it. It brings about relative facts and details about the future, which can lead to spontaneous actions. It filters information based on standards (often invisible) formed judgments. Fi often coordinates values. It naturally and subtly aligns with subtle differences and knows what is right and wrong.</p>
                    <h3>Personality Blind Spots</h3>
                    <p>Because INTPs rely too much on their rational analysis, they may overlook things related to others. If something doesn't make sense to them, even if it's important to them, they may risk abandoning it. Admitting what they truly care about will help them stay in touch with their true feelings.</p>
                    <p>INTPs are good at observing the flaws of a thought but are silent about expressing their opinions. Because they refuse to exist in a plan, they are slow to address a minor flaw in a plan, making the entire plan difficult to complete. When they use their highly honed critical thinking on others, their honesty can become an unintended hurt. They must be told and must learn to ask about things related to others' feelings.</p>
                    <p>Because INTPs like to solve problems, they often lack patience for routine details and will lose interest and never complete a plan if a plan requires too many details or persistence. Transferring their energy outward will allow them to gain sufficient practical knowledge to generate feasible and acceptable ideas.</p>
                    <p>When INTPs strive to maintain their high standards of perfection, they may feel troubled. Sharing feelings with others will help them gain a more realistic and objective perspective.</p>
                    <h3>Suitable Careers</h3>
                    <p>Most people like to work in the technical field, using their unique abilities to analyze complex systems and form creative solutions. For example: software designers, network administrators, computer engineers, system analysts, research and development professionals, strategic planners, financial planners, comic book designers, analysts, etc.</p>
                    <p>The medical and technology fields can fully utilize your excellent judgment and reasoning skills, working at the forefront of complex and high-level concepts, and with a certain level of risk in your work. For example: physicists, beauticians, pharmacists, veterinarians, biologists, etc.</p>
                    <p>You have clear and logical thinking and creative skills in those professional and commercial fields that use these methods to solve problems. For example: lawyers, economists, psychologists, architects, financial analysts, business analysts, intelligence experts, translators, etc.</p>
                    <p>Those fields that allow you to create something completely new and those that can experience many different things are also worth considering. For example: photographers, writers, artists, inventors, astronomers, producers, music organizers, graphic designers, etc.</p>
                    <p>Career satisfaction will make your work more proactive, more positive, and more willing to work. The following are not just telling you what jobs are suitable for you, but细化帮你分析工作中的哪些特质对你重要，你需要从中选出最重要的，因为不同经历的人对特质的重要程度要求是不同的。每个岗位的工作内容都在随企业的发展而发展，不是一成不变的，有时候岗位的发展方向需要我们自己去争取。所以找到适合的工作不如找到适合自己发展的岗位更直接。这些特质可以帮助明确如何主动的发展或争取你岗位中的那些特质。</p>
                    <h3>About Partners</h3>
                    <p>As a scholar, you may be a mystery to your partner. You can navigate the logical loop of wisdom with anyone.</p>
                    <p>Scholars are not patient with fools. Your partner must be quick-witted, intelligent, and able to keep up with your excited and fast-paced ideas and plans. While appearance may matter, the most important thing when choosing a lifelong partner is to consider their intelligence. Even if you are initially attracted to someone emotionally, you will quickly adjust and start logical thinking. No matter how good or attractive your partner is, you must meet your logical requirements before you give your love. Many scholars do not pay attention to their emotional side and do not pay attention to their partners' emotional needs. At the same time, due to their introverted nature, scholars may not be able to adapt to social etiquette, causing embarrassment and foolishness, even for their more worldly partners.</p>
                    <p>Scholars can be highly adaptable and good partners as long as they can improve their shortcomings and use their strengths, such as their strong imagination and gentle personality, to strengthen their interpersonal relationships. When they do this, scholars can enjoy very successful emotional and marital relationships.</p>
                    <h3>About Love</h3>
                    <p>Strengths in love:
                        Having a pure and caring love for those around you like a child, usually relaxed and easy to get along with, willing to follow your companions, passionate about things you're interested in, full of imagination and creativity, not seeing conflicts and criticism as attacks on yourself, usually not demanding, just satisfied with daily needs</p>
                    <p>Weaknesses in love:
                        Born unable to pay attention to others' feelings, slow to respond to others' emotional needs, born unable to express their own feelings and emotions, tend to lack trust in others, always skeptical, usually not good at practical matters, such as finance, unless their work involves this field, difficult to leave a relationship without a future, tend to escape conflicts and quarrels, or go to the extreme - exploding</p>
                    <h3>Advantages in Work</h3>
                    <p>Eager to "know what's outside the box," can think of new possibilities; able to understand very complex and highly abstract concepts; outstanding skills in creative problem-solving, with an adventurous spirit, creative awareness, and the courage to overcome difficulties; independent and able to work alone, and fully focused; able to synthesize and use a large amount of information; rational curiosity and unique insight in gathering information; even under pressure, they can logically analyze things; like to learn new knowledge and skills, have a lot of confidence and motivation; objective; able to objectively analyze and handle problems without being emotional; full of confidence in their ideas and opinions; able to foresee the long-term impact of behavior and thinking, able to grasp the overall situation, and understand the long-term impact of behavior and thinking; able to adapt flexibly to new situations and have the ability to handle unexpected situations; have a stable and positive attitude; have energy and initiative, not worrying about得失</p>
                    <h3>Disadvantages in Work</h3>
                    <p>Things may not be organized, may become chaotic; overly confident; may misuse their abilities and social experiences; lack patience for narrow-minded and stubborn people; dislike traditional, formulaic approaches; lose interest easily once a problem is solved, no longer exist, unable to implement and carry out; not good at expressing complex ideas and problems in simple ways and solving them; may be overly theoretical and ignore or overlook reality, some ideas may not be realistic; unable to strictly require themselves to focus on and solve important details; dislike repetitive tasks and people who are stubborn; your thoughts and opinions are too complex for others to understand; slow to respond to others' criticism and requests; lack of motivation, easy to slack off, usually unwilling to put in too much effort; not persistent enough in the face of pressure and挫折</p>
                    <h3>Development Suggestions</h3>
                    <p>INFJ's key to success is: being more organized, trying to stick to plans; being patient with others; understanding others' feelings and reactions, improving interpersonal relationships.</p>
                    <p>Work can challenge complex problems, try some innovative methods, and take risks to find better results.</p>
                    <p>Work can continuously improve your abilities and power, working with talented people.</p>
                    <p>Let you focus your energy on creative, theoretical logical processes rather than final results.</p>
                    <p>No need to spend time organizing or managing others, mediating interpersonal relationships.</p>
                    <p>Work environment is flexible and relaxed, without too many restrictions, rules, and tedious meetings.</p>
                    <p>Work independently, need plenty of undisturbed time, have many things that need deep thinking.</p>
