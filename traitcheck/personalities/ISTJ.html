                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>ISTJ (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging) individuals are serious, responsible, and reasonable social pillars. They are trustworthy and value commitments - to them, words are solemn oaths. ISTJs work meticulously, are practical, intelligent, and realistic. They possess strong concentration, organization, and accuracy. Whatever they do is orderly and reliable. They have firm, well-thought-out ideas, and once they embark on what they believe to be the best course of action, they are difficult to deter or discourage.</p>
                    <h3>Personality Traits</h3>
                    <p>ISTJs are particularly quiet and diligent, with strong memory and judgment for details. They can cite accurate facts to support their views and apply past experiences to current decisions. They value and utilize logical, objective analysis, completing work punctually with persistent attitudes and always maintaining order and organization. They value necessary theoretical systems and traditional conventions, and become impatient with those who don't work this way.</p>
                    <p>ISTJs are always traditional and cautious. They listen to and prefer factual, clear statements of matters. ISTJs naturally dislike showing off, appearing calm even in times of crisis. They always appear duty-bound and steadfast, but beneath their calm exterior, they may have strong but rarely expressed reactions.</p>
                    <h3>Function Usage</h3>
                    <p>Extraversion and introversion indicate the direction of our psychological energy, while judging and perceiving are two ways we handle matters. Psychology calls these "attitudes". Sensing and intuition are how we gather information, while thinking and feeling are ways of making decisions, which psychology calls "functions" - the essence and core of personality theory.</p>
                    <p>Everyone uses four functions, but their preferences for function usage are different. The first function is called the "dominant function", and the second is called the "auxiliary function". Everyone needs to use both processes.</p>
                    <p>Effectively use your type: ISTJs' dominant function is (Attention to Detail), and their auxiliary function is Thinking. They tend to: pay attention to details, value practicality, remember trivial details, tolerate tedious work, be patient, and have a systematic approach.</p>
                    <p>Logical, analytical, objective, fair, and logical thinking. They are less likely to use their third and fourth functions - emotions and intuition. Even when these functions are needed, they are not effective.</p>
                    <p>As an ISTJ, if you use your sensing function too much, you may lose the big picture, not see different ways to solve problems, rely on intuition, not innovate, and not handle complex tasks. If you use your thinking function too much, you may forget to praise others in time or ignore the impact of your decisions on others.</p>
                    <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
                    <p>Everyone makes decisions in their own way, usually based on their dominant function and completely ignoring their fourth function. Your function usage is as follows:</p>
                    <p>Dominant function: Sensing</p>
                    <p>Auxiliary function: Thinking</p>
                    <p>Third function: Emotions</p>
                    <p>Fourth function: Intuition</p>
                    <p>A good decision usually comes from the rational use of all four functions. When you try to solve problems, you can use the table above to guide this process, but it's very difficult to execute this process in real life because no one wants to use the function they don't like to solve problems. Even if you consciously try to use all these functions, you won't be able to use them in the "real world" in this order. The key is to use them to remind yourself to improve decision-making, even if you don't follow this order.</p>
                    <p>Choosing a job that aligns with your dominant function and auxiliary function is important. The third function needs to be developed and used appropriately, and the fourth function may never play a key role in your career, so you should avoid jobs that require long-term use of it.</p>
                    <h3>Blind Spots</h3>
                    <p>A common problem for ISTJs is losing oneself in planning details and daily operations. Once immersed, they are rigid and unwilling to adapt or accept different perspectives. If they don't see the direct and effective application of new ideas, they often question and must spend time paying attention to all objective matters, considering alternative options they may not have considered, collecting a wider range of information, and consciously trying to predict the long-term implications of their behavior. This can help improve the impact of ISTJs on others.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes ISTJs have difficulty understanding the needs of others, especially those very different from themselves. Because their reactions are hidden, they are seen as calm and unemotional. They must express their appreciation openly rather than keeping it to themselves.</p>
                    <p>Because ISTJs are organized, they expect others to be the same. They impose their judgment on others, ignoring the opinions of those who are not very confident. They insist that others follow their methods and prevent the use of more creative and innovative methods. They should be open to new and unconventional ways to be more tolerant of differences and ultimately make effective decisions.</p>

                    <h3>About Love</h3>
                    <p><strong>Best Dating Match: Perfectionist</strong></p>
                    <p>If you are an Inspector type...</p>
                    <p>You are the glue that holds the pieces of civilization together. Your trademark is task, discipline, responsibility, and organization. Without your faithful dedication, many existing successful enterprises, organizations, and groups would fall apart. When in love, you are the most practical of all relationship types, and you're not particularly moved by excessive romantic gestures. You don't need constant excitement in dating. You're content with a dinner at home, an interesting movie, and your lover's company.</p>
                    <p>When it comes to gender role positioning, your values are also traditional. You still believe that a husband should earn money to support the family, and a wife should be responsible for maintaining a tidy and organized home. Your strong need for security makes you avoid the risks of starting a relationship. You usually develop a relationship with someone you've known for a long time: a colleague, a family friend, or a classmate. Because you're the final "nest builder," you need to be very sure that the person you're about to let into your life is someone who can take care of you and support the family.
                    </p>
                    <p>You expect the traits your partner should have, which are loyalty, security, and responsibility. You won't be particularly moved by your partner's future or lofty ideals; what you need to know is what your partner can bring to a serious relationship right now.</p>
                    <p>You'll have a good relationship with female Inspector types or Caregiver types (ISFJ). Female Inspector types are disciplined and often responsible, which can perfectly complement your desire for a traditional family. The Caregiver type is the woman who helps you build your dream family with her loving approach and "standard mom" personality.</p>
                    <p>Inspector types are often attracted to tasks, work, and organizations that involve tasks, work, and responsibility. You can try to join community groups that maintain order and cleanliness, charity groups, parent-teacher association meetings, patriotic organizations, professional associations, government agencies, bowling clubs, business review committees, and military special events such as air shows and parades. (Inspector types are often excellent military officers because they are very loyal, diligent, and willing to follow orders.)</p>
                    <p>How to date an Inspector type?</p>
                    <p>Make them feel needed, or work towards a worthy goal with them, so you can have a legitimate reason to meet them. Go to the library, and chat with the librarian while they help you log out the books you've borrowed. Attend a parent-teacher association meeting - there are often single parents there - ask Inspector types about the child education issues they're most interested in.</p>
                    <p>You can volunteer for a political event or participate in a neighborhood watch event, and you'll meet many Inspector types who are highly responsible and enthusiastic about their tasks.</p>
                    <p>Love Tips: Emphasize the traditional aspects of your personality, such as: Men: Talk about your career aspirations and how much money you can bring to your family, and your future vision of a safe and prosperous home. Express your desire to be a great father and build a safe and prosperous family.
                        Women: Emphasize your home management skills or abilities, such as cooking, cleaning, and sewing. If you have no experience with household chores, it's time to read books or take courses. Talk about your expectations for children, security, and tradition. Note: Inspector types are not suitable for all women, but if you're willing to accept some traditional values, their stable and conservative view of family life will be very attractive to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>Love Tips: Meet Inspector type's expectations for punctuality, cleanliness, and organization. Always remember to be punctual and clean when you date Inspector types. When you're with them, please keep it clean to leave a good impression on them. Also, if you're planning to invite your Inspector type partner home, make sure your house is clean and tidy.</p>
                    <p>Love Tips: Help your Inspector type partner clean their house or ask them to help you clean your house. If you really want to capture your Inspector type's heart, you can suggest helping them clean their house to meet their desire for cleanliness and orderliness. You can also ask your Inspector type to help you clean and organize your house. If they agree, prepare some snacks and music to make that day enjoyable. Warning: Make sure your house is clean enough when the Inspector type arrives with a mop, vacuum cleaner, and cloth. Although they're here to help you clean your house, they don't want to see a real mess. Once your house meets the standard (in your opinion), you can invite them over. When your Inspector type partner uses amazing cleaning skills to make your house a standard that most people can't reach, let them do their thing.</p>
                    <p>How to have a good sexual relationship with an Inspector type?</p>
                    <p>A sexual relationship with an Inspector type is a slow process. Don't expect to have an immediate spark with an Inspector type; when it comes to sex and love, they are the most conservative and cautious of all relationship types.</p>
                    <p>Sex Tips: Introduce a new pose or technique in a relaxed conversation first. During the conversation, emphasize how the new technique will improve your relationship and bring you closer together. Then, keep quiet so your Inspector type partner can digest what you've said.</p>
                    <p>Sex Tips: Create a sexual time table. To help your Inspector type partner feel safe with new sexual activities, create a sexual time table. Although some relationship types may find this planned approach boring, many Inspector types feel comfortable and safe if they know their partner's expectations (and when it happens).</p>
                    <p>Relationship Status: The most practical of all relationship types, you don't need constant excitement in dating, and you won't be moved by excessive romantic gestures. You're content with a dinner at home, a walk, or your partner's company. In terms of gender role positioning, your values are also traditional. You believe that a husband should earn money to support the family, and a wife should be responsible for household chores and maintaining a tidy home. You usually don't fall in love at first sight and are more likely to develop a relationship with someone you've known for a long time, such as classmates, colleagues, or friends.
