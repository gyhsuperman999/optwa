                    <h3>Basic Description</h3>
                    <p>Providing is the act of supplying life necessities to others. Providers seem naturally inclined to serve others, ensuring they have a sense of material abundance and group belonging. They consciously take on the responsibility of caring for those around them and arranging their welfare, and they are the most sociable among the Guardian types. Wherever they go, they take on the role of social contributors, happily dedicating their time and energy to ensure others' needs are met, traditions are maintained and developed, and social duties are fulfilled completely.</p>
                    <p>Due to their kind and gentle nature, they prefer the role of caretaker, and being extroverted and graceful, they seem to prefer being providers rather than protectors. They make up 10% of the population, with 95% being female, which is fortunate for us because cooperation and social convenience are key to their human structure. They excel at working with their assistants and tirelessly attend to all details of goods and services arrangements.</p>
                    <p>These expressive guardians are graceful, talkative, and become uneasy when isolated. Even among strangers, they can start a conversation and chat pleasantly. They show a strong interest in small talk about everything. They are more accustomed to thinking about visible rather than fictional things, and easily recognize and discuss major events or difficulties in people's lives. While they struggle with abstract topics, they tend to listen to recognized authorities, hear theories about abstract things, and often rely on officially approved views as standards and basis for their judgments.</p>
                    <p>Social traditions are significant to providers, and their conversations often drift into nostalgic narratives about experiences from the good old days, but at the same time, they may put excessive pressure on others by expressing predictions of sadness and misfortune and showing contagious tragic tendencies. They need to control their fear of the notion that "the worst will definitely happen."</p>
                    <p>Providers have excessive sensitivity and are very willing to express these emotional responses. They can quickly express likes or dislikes, placing favored people in prominent positions while rarely mentioning those they dislike. They always care about appearances and seriously adopt others' opinions about their personal commitments. Personal criticism can devastate them, and they only effectively perform their duties when they and their services are recognized. They want to be needed and spend time and energy proving they are trustworthy. They become dejected when treated unfriendly and tend to take responsibility for any possible mistakes in their systems or relationships.</p>
                    <p>When choosing careers, providers might prefer service industries. Providers demonstrate how to personalize sales when handling sales matters; they obviously and honestly consider customers' welfare, so customers not only buy products from them but also buy personal welfare. Their personality enables them to excel in many people-oriented jobs, they rarely anger leadership because they are duty and service-oriented, respecting and following rules and regulations. Loyal to bosses, they can become capable personal secretaries and office receptionists.</p>

                    <p>ESFJs hope others can appreciate their true selves while being grateful for their efforts for others. This need for recognition sometimes makes them extremely craving emotional satisfaction. If this craving can't be satisfied, they might constantly hint at their partner seeking recognition. ESFJs particularly can't tolerate contradictions or criticism. Any form of criticism feels like an insult to their personality. This potential issue needs ESFJs' attention. When facing others' negative evaluations or lacking positive recognition, ESFJs usually appear dejected and start self-destructing. For ESFJ's lovers, a grateful heart is the best gift.</p>
                    <p>ESFJs pay great attention to social status and "others' opinions." They should be careful not to let these emotions affect their relationships.</p>

                    <p>Although any two individuals of any personality type can have a healthy relationship if their personalities are fully developed, the natural partners more suitable for ESFJs are ISFP, ISFJ, or INFP personality types. ESFJs' dominant function "extroverted feeling" matches best with these two personality types' dominant function "introverted feeling".</p>
