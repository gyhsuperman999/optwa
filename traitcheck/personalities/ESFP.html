                    <p>The Performer - Continuously trying new challenges</p>
                    <p>You enjoy entertaining people, bringing them (and yourself) as much love, laughter, and enthusiasm as possible. As a performer, you crave the spotlight while enjoying interacting with all the people in your joyful circle. The unhappiest thing is to be alone, but fortunately, you rarely are. For true performers, life is a never-ending party.</p>
                    <h3>Potential Blind Spots</h3>
                    <p>Because you focus on various external information changes and like handling emergencies, you're unwilling to make plans to prevent emergencies.

                    <p>Your attention is completely focused on interesting activities, you like constantly accepting new challenges, unwilling to spend time on boring work, and find it difficult to estimate the consequences of your actions. You need to set a standard of behavior for yourself. When situations change, you can easily overlook others' feelings and become insensitive and rash.</p>
                    <h3>Strengths at Work</h3>
                    <p>Keen observation, excellent memory for practical information; understanding what needs to be done, understanding realistic conditions necessary for completing work; pleasure in initiating and promoting projects; energetic, full of vitality at work; ability to adapt to circumstances; ability to make work interesting and exciting; enjoyment of teamwork; practical, realistic observation and rich common sense; gradual progression, creating a lively and interesting atmosphere at work; adaptability, willingness to take risks and try new things; willingness to accept differences and follow trends; having a stable and peaceful mindset; having drive and courage, not overthinking gains and losses</p>

                    <h3>Job Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>Working in an environment without too many rule constraints, having free time after completing tasks</p>
                    <p>Work that can utilize your "firefighting" abilities, using direct experience to find the best solutions to problems</p>
                    <p>Working with real people and matters, manufacturing or serving tangible products, rather than theoretical and ideological fields</p>
                    <p>Work full of challenges, allowing you to handle emergencies in adventurous ways</p>
                    <p>Work that can utilize your keen observation, understanding, and memory for facts</p>
                    <p>Work that allows you to meet various people and interact openly with practical, energetic colleagues</p>
                    <h3>Suitable Careers</h3>

                    <p>You enjoy adventure and some excitement, so certain entertainment jobs will bring you career satisfaction. For example: journalist, travel agent, cameraman, host, actor, auctioneer, etc.</p>
                    <p>You're good at manual operations, which can bring economic and technical improvement and continuous practice.

                    <p>Environments with too many restrictions are not work environments you need to consider; usually, free, diverse work that can provide adventure opportunities is more suitable for you.

                    <h3>Development Suggestions</h3>
