                    <p>The most important thing for INFJ type people is to be loyal to their own vision. Under the calm exterior, they have a deeper faith in important life events.

However, this will also be greatly appreciated because it shows a sincere commitment to love and a depth of care that other types of people do not have. In terms of sex, INFJ views intimacy as an experience close to the spiritual level. They value this opportunity to be with their partner in a spiritual and physical union. As a people-centered person, their partner's happiness is very important to them. Intimacy is an opportunity for INFJ to give their love unconditionally, and it is also an opportunity to experience love in a clear way.

                    <h3>Idealism</h3>
                    <p><strong>Language - Abstract</strong> This applies to things that cannot be observed and depend solely on imagination. Idealists often talk about things that are imagined. Idealists' thoughts and language are naturally inductive. They are sharp and can draw general conclusions from details. They understand the whole from the small details of things. They value their own feelings and believe that "definitely know" what people really want. They often use metaphors and like to use descriptive language. They are indifferent to social hierarchy and are highly sensitive to the body language, facial expressions, etc. of other types.

                    <p><strong>Tools - Cooperative</strong> Idealists believe that the tools and actions chosen by people need to be accepted by others, although sometimes they are not as effective as those that are not recognized. They are very confused by the utilitarian behavior that is too cold or one-sided. They worry about the good side of human nature and therefore lose it. Idealists first consider creating satisfying interpersonal relationships. Their ideal is to help people around them get along well with each other so that they can work together for the common good. Most idealists are not interested in business and many pursue careers in the natural sciences. They usually choose to communicate with language and hope to communicate directly or indirectly with others. Idealists are very easily moved by literary works and tend to explain them using their natural sensitivity. They enjoy any form of fictional description - stories, poems, legends, myths, can make them happy and strong. Idealists are not limited to literary studies. They are highly concentrated in the social sciences. Especially in mental health services, they can get a lot of satisfaction from the most humanistic approach. They are willing to do anything to make people feel good and are passionate about moral and right judgment, rather than cultivating a positive self-image. Idealists and Guardians are both moral guardians, but the former cares about happiness, while the latter cares about justice. They have a very special talent in recruiting, training, subordinates, developing, and advising. They are good at influencing the growth and maturity of others. They do not see education as a training and verification process, but as an invitation to personal relationships. Building interpersonal relationships is crucial to them, but excessive interference in others' affairs may be annoying. And excessive complex interpersonal relationships can lead to mental overload. They are future people, focusing on what is about to happen rather than reality. They are future people, focusing on what is about to happen rather than reality.</p>

                    <h3>Values</h3>
                    <p>Idealists are very emotional, meaning they fall in love quickly and fall out of love quickly. Fortunately, they tend to the positive side, so their emotions often appear as great enthusiasm. Idealists trust the power of intuition and rely on first impressions without verification. They trust their intuition without reservation and will bring others' feelings to their feelings area, wanting to empathize and draw closer. They are all steadfast romantics who crave romance in all aspects. If they don't, they will cultivate it. They invest a lot of time in pursuing their own essence, human meaning, to express their true self and view this as the most important thing in their life. To make them feel appreciated, we must face them and "accommodate their worldview" when they express their feelings. They are often misunderstood or forced to play the wrong role due to social reality. The people they care about are very important to them. They are idealistic people most respected for their role model, the effort to overcome material, secular concerns, and the enlightened understanding of life for men and women.

                    <h3>Spiritual Partner</h3>
                    <p>Idealists are the most different type of people when it comes to dealing with marriage issues. Other types of people view marriage as a practical matter and believe that partners will make mistakes and compromise. Idealists, on the other hand, will choose lovers and marriage based on idealism and romanticism. They seek a mysterious and profound marriage relationship and try to create it even if it doesn't exist. Idealists are the most different type of people when it comes to dealing with marriage issues.

                    <h3>Choosing a Partner</h3>
                    <p>Idealists usually do not make a commitment to anyone and prefer to date one person at a time to explore the possibility of developing a special close relationship. They do not like casual or temporary dates and are unique in their expectations for shallow relationships to become deep. They like to discuss movies or novels that have deeply touched them, but tend to discuss the profound meanings of stories rather than simply describing the plot. This imaginative and meaningful way of interacting with people, their ability to freely communicate with people, often determines whether idealists can seriously consider a specific romantic relationship. Idealists are difficult to find someone who shares their inner world. It is a process of trial and error, requiring careful searching. For idealists, dating is not just about physical pleasure or social experience, but about opening their hearts to another person. To some extent, it is also their soul's revelation, containing promises and expectations of respect and understanding. Therefore, they are highly sensitive to rejection and will actively end the relationship if they feel disrespected. The emotional breakdown brings them a lot of pain, so they sometimes avoid getting involved with others or going to the extreme, that is, keeping a relationship just to postpone the inevitable mental pain. However, once this special person appears, idealists will be excited and will strive for this romantic relationship. For idealists, not just a happy marriage, but also an extraordinary strong and eternal emotional relationship is about to arrive. They will not hesitate to pay a lot of effort or imagination, not just as a romantic gesture, but also as their idealization of love. They can feel the romantic and poetic feelings of their loved one from the slightest signs and believe that everyone has the potential for spiritual growth and wants to use love to explore their potential. Perhaps idealists do not want to admit that these romantic ideas often have strong sexual impulses and can become a problem. Idealists' sexual feelings may vary greatly. On the one hand, they believe that sexual behavior must be an expression of love, not desire; on the other hand, they are very passionate in their ideal world and are easily moved by beautiful bodies and sensuality. Once two people are together, idealists will feel the greatest happiness. However, the expectation of being together is more attractive than the act itself. The daily reality, losing its mystery, brings out ordinary and lack. Other types of people may feel that life has differences, but they will turn these differences into something positive through adjustment, travel, and effort. However, male idealists are the most vulnerable in this regard. They tend to seek a new lover rather than put effort into developing their current relationship. Female idealists will not, on the contrary, become more involved, continuing to make the relationship romantic, and believing in its perfection. For male idealists, intimacy can lead to instability; for females, it is an indispensable part. However, it should be noted that in the 19th century, around the 1860s and 1870s, perhaps due to female idealists' imagination of a more perfect marriage relationship. The majority of idealists do not place the social customs of marriage above their personal commitment. Therefore, when they are sure that they have deepened their relationship with their partner and have exchanged vows, they consider themselves married. The wedding ceremony and understanding become an unnecessary burden and may appear confused and bewildered at the altar, until they are alone with their spouse. These idealists are warm, generous, lively, and emotional. They are cautious about interpersonal relationships and are very attractive to other personality types. Artists feel that their unique romantic touch is very familiar and can be morally elevated by the ethical elements that idealists inject into marriage. Guardians feel safe and get some energy from their involvement. However, the most interesting thing about idealists is the rationalist, not only because of their similarities, but also because of idealists' emotional vitality and their understanding of humanity, which are lacking in rationalists. They are passionate and empathetic, but they are also very deep. They seek and enhance passionate and meaningful emotional relationships. They have a tendency towards perfectionism and are always striving for the most fundamental emotional relationships. In most cases, this is a positive trait, but it can be detrimental to INFJ. They may develop the habit of moving from one relationship to another, always looking for a more perfect partner. In general, INFJ is a very gentle and caring person. They put a lot of effort into maintaining healthy close relationships and are willing to pay a lot of effort to maintain their positive attitude. Because of these special qualities, they win the respect of those close to them. They seek long-term, lifelong emotional relationships, although they may not always find them.</p>

                    <h3>Family</h3>
                    <p>They are a group of passionate little guys, known as "temperamental people," because their emotions are very easily triggered and can sometimes appear in a very strong and surprising way. As children, they were always motivated by a passion, almost unable to keep their emotions calm. They may have started talking early, extroverted, and never stopped talking in their parents' eyes; introverted, with strong emotions, but often shy about expressing them, perhaps with some difficulties in interpersonal communication, especially outside the family. They are often very sensitive to the feelings of their closest family members. When the family members are in harmony, their self-esteem is at peace; when their parents or siblings are sad, they also become sad. If the family is happy, the child's self-esteem can develop early and quickly; if not, they lack the ability to handle problems calmly. They tend to show their good intentions rather than provide specific help to others. They have a high moral expectation from childhood and hope that their attitude and behavior towards others are perfect. They feel uncomfortable in front of others and rarely seek applause. They also try to adapt to others and like to be praised by adults, but not to rely on it. They hope that others recognize them as independent individuals. They feel the difference between themselves and others, but they do not understand what this difference is. Idealists and rationalists may feel some distance from others. However, rationalists still insist on their own way, and idealists are also satisfied with their uniqueness. Idealists need their parents to recognize their uniqueness and to acknowledge their important role in their lives. They need this message: "You are a special person, I value you, and you are important to me." They are most trusting of others and believe in intuition more than behavior norms. They are also more likely to believe that stories are true, even if they are stubborn. They like to listen to stories repeatedly and create some stories themselves. They like the stories of knights in the Middle Ages, princes, princesses, evil forces, and witches. They should guide them to read stories with happy endings, such as knights winning, villains repenting, so they will be attracted to eternal happiness, no matter how many hopes and dreams are destroyed by the cold reality. Idealists' children are very precious to them. If they are lost or accidentally discarded by their parents, they will feel unhappy. They often treat toys as friends. Of course, they will also be laughed at and rejected, which will make them feel the feeling of being rejected. Idealists' children are altruistic and are worldwide. They are also very young and have a certain skepticism. They are always full of enthusiasm for exploring a worthy belief. They are always trying to establish close and harmonious relationships with their children. They hope to integrate into their children's lives and promote them with their positive image. They are always there for their children, and they are never-ending. Idealists' children are very precious to them.
