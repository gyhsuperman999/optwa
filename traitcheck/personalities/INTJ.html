                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>INTJ type people are perfectionists. They strongly demand personal freedom and capability, while their unwavering belief in their original thoughts drives them to achieve their goals. INTJ type people think rigorously, logically, and are resourceful. They can see the results of new plans and theoretical systems that transform into real material in life. They are demanding of both themselves and others, often pushing others as hard as themselves. They are not much disturbed by indifference and criticism. As the most independent of all personality types, INTJ type people prefer to do things their own way. When faced with opposing opinions, they usually maintain a skeptical attitude and are very firm and determined.</p>
                    <h3>Personality Traits</h3>
                    <p>INTJ (Introverted/Intuitive/Thinking/Judging) is one of the sixteen personality types in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, known as the Mastermind in the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, and is one of the four types of rationalists. INTJ is one of the rarest types, making up only 1% of the population.</p>
                    <p>INTJ people are perfectionists who seem to have endless ability to improve anything they're interested in. Unlike idealists, INTJs pursue perfect results through practical pragmatism and action.</p>
                    <p>INTJ people are known as "system builders" because of their unusual combination of imagination and certainty. In any system, they think the same way, because they are the people with INTJ personality. They are perfectionists and disdain authority, which may show in their ruthless treatment of others in a project. Any "slacker," including superiors, will lose the respect of INTJ people, and they will usually make them aware of this. They often show their other side.</p>
                    <p>INTJ people can make major decisions without consulting their superiors or colleagues. On the other hand, they can carefully and fairly divide personal contributions in a project. They have a natural talent for seizing opportunities, and some opportunities others may not notice.</p>
                    <p>Typical INTJ people's career direction is in science and engineering, but they may also be interested in fields that require both wisdom and sharp words (such as lawyers, certain areas of academia).</p>
                    <h3>Suitable Careers</h3>
                    <p>Securities investment and financial analyst, intellectual property lawyer, investment banker, economist, entrepreneur, cardiologist, artist, economics scholar, various inventors, medical expert, various scientists, international banking staff, financial planner, network engineer, database expert, research institute researcher, systems analyst, computer programmer, R&D manager, various technical consultants, technical expert, investment expert, legal consultant, psychiatrist, investment banking researcher, chief financial officer, design engineer, financial planner, corporate merger and acquisition expert, architect, editorial writer, media planner</p>
                    <h3>Handling Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>They have unique thoughts, great vision, and dreams. They are naturally good at theory and flexible with complex and comprehensive concepts. They are excellent strategic thinkers who can clearly see the advantages and disadvantages of any situation. For interesting problems, they are good organizers with foresight and insight. If it's their own views and plans, they will invest incredible attention, energy, and enthusiasm. Through determination and persistence to reach or exceed their high standards, they achieve many accomplishments.</p>
                    <h3>Strengths</h3>
                    <p>Consider issues rationally, clearly, and concisely, unaffected by others, objectively criticizing everything, making judgments using highly rational thinking, not based on emotions. View everything with a critical eye, and when circumstances require, can be very strong and decisive.</p>
                    <p>INTJ type people do not submit to authority and are very intelligent, have good judgment, are strict with themselves, almost perfect, and even demand the same from others. They especially dislike those who are helpless, chaotic, and inefficient. They have strong self-control, do things their own way, and won't be disturbed by others' coldness and criticism. They are the most independent of all personalities.</p>
                    <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
                    <p>INTJ types often only focus on themselves, rarely understand others, are self-righteous, have no patience with others, always take for granted and impose their views on others, and set unrealistic high standards.</p>
                    <p>Too focused on vision and insight, easily overlooking and missing details and phenomena that don't fit their theoretical model; like to play intellectual games, saying seemingly meaningful but actually meaningless words to others.</p>
                    <h3>Life</h3>
                    <p>INTJ feels it's not worth socializing with "ordinary people," just maintaining basic necessary relationships is enough. They know "ordinary people" won't like them. They like to analyze and judge others but prefer to analyze and criticize themselves. They think others are mundane, but they are also very picky about their self-evaluation. It's not narcissism, just perfectionism.</p>
                    <h3>Leadership Ability</h3>
                    <p>Few things can stump an INTJ (Note: this mainly refers to work; ability to handle emotional matters depends on each INTJ individual's cognitive function development. Underdeveloped cognitive functions may make it difficult to handle emotional issues). Therefore, these people usually get promoted quickly in companies, their composure indicating excellent leadership abilities. Unlike other types of leaders, INTJs usually appear as calm observers in organizations, but if they find the team lacks leadership or the current leader is incompetent, they will unhesitatingly become the new leader.</p>
                    <h3>Views</h3>
                    <p>INTJ generally belongs to the type of person who likes to compete with themselves, and others may find their life and work very tiring. They themselves may not feel this way, being immersed in their own world. People around them find it hard to understand how creating a blueprint after many sleepless nights can bring any spiritual joy, especially when surrounded by many extroverts.</p>
                    <p>INTJ's introversion is usually very obvious in large gatherings, but in small groups, INTJs can be very proactive, bold in expressing opinions, and act as leaders. In fact, INTJs have quite strong desire for power. Perfectionism is actually the pursuit of ultimate power. This power is not merely the commonly called official addiction, but being the ultimate controller of things.</p>
                    <p>When alone, INTJs basically never stop thinking. And often what they think about is extremely logical and philosophical big topics, such as life and death, success and fame, or the mysteries of the universe. They will never waste brain cells on things like which supermarket has sales. I've found that INTJs often think about completely different things while doing ordinary tasks, and these thoughts are abstract, such as life and death, success, or universal mysteries.</p>
                    <h3>Leadership Ability</h3>
                    <p><strong>Self-confident and Practical</strong>: These four tendencies are the personality traits that most people rely on to seek confidence and strength, especially those in the upper levels of company hierarchical structures. INTJs don't constantly disturb us like extroverted personalities do; they convey their confidence through keeping everything well under control. Compared to sensing (S) types who focus on details and concrete things, they transform facts into a macro blueprint and provide development prospects. Sometimes subjectivity may be more agreeable, but in actual business activities, we emphasize more on objectivity, that is, being more practical. Our society's operation favors J-type people, and the whole society is also a result-oriented model. When INTJ-type people integrate these four traits together, they not only appear attractive on the surface, but they are also indeed reliable and dependable objects for leadership and decision-making levels.</p>
                    <h3>Fine Management</h3>
                    <p><strong>Detailed Planning</strong>: Strategists far exceed others in fine management. Each step of the plan must coordinate with the next step and may be subject to unpredictable difficulties. Their decisive, good at planning, and reserved nature determines that they tend to take on the role of strategist. They make up less than 1% of the total population and are hard to encounter. Although they are very capable leaders, they are not keen on entering management and would rather hide in a quiet place unless the leader is too incompetent.</p>
